Project Introduction

This project is based on modifications made to Jonas Schmedtmann's course. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to him, as I do not fully own the original concept of this project.

This project serves as my practice on effectively using AJAX and integrating APIs to streamline the overall programming process, making it clearer and easier to modify. The primary content of the project has been largely retained, with minimal modifications and no additional features added. The focus was on enhancing my skills in these areas while maintaining the integrity of the original design.
